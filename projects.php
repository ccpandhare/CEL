					<H3>SocialWeYou</H3>
					<P>The specialized cell was created with focus on how businesses are moving from 'Interruption-based' marketing to 'relationship-based' conversations by connecting to people who in-turn become evangelists of a brand. It is this stimulus which changes mere brands to movements led by people. It was the first of its kind in any entrepreneurship cell in India. While the usage of web tools remains indispensible, it will focus on specialised verticals like Non-profits, Startups, e-Governance and e-commerce in the future. SocialWeYou will be the brand that the social media cell of CEL will start up with.</P>
